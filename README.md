# Heroes-of-Pymoli

-- Project Status: Completed

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to mine through player data in the fictional game Heroes of Pymoli for meaingful insights to understand player interactions with the game, and identify revenue streams. By mining data trends such as average microtransaction purchase price, total purchases, and age/gender demographics. The company can focus advertising campaigns and direct developer projects of in game purchase items with a better understanding of their consumer base. While identifying high earning items and those bringing little return to the company.

## Conclusions
With male gamers making up the bulk of in-game purchases, and almost half of purchase revenue coming from the 20-24 year old age range. We can infer that it sould be smart to market the game in areas with a known audience of men in their early 20's. I would also suggest a tiered loyalty system for the game's users with the highest number of in-game purchases to incentivize more sales and better relations with the best customers.
